## Releases

AmongUs Version: **2023.6.13**
**Latest Version: [Here](https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/)**

## Regarding This Mod

Project: Lotus (The Mod) is considered a Host Only Mod (or, Host Only Environment). This means that only The Host needs to install the mod (on a Windows Operating System) for it to work. Once The Host creates a modded lobby, clients (players) from any device are able to join and enjoy The Mod.<br>

#### The Following Restriction(s) Apply<br>

- If The Host leaves in the middle of a game, The Mod will no longer work (i.e. the roles will no longer function as intended). This happens regardless of whether the client is modded (has joined with The Mod) or not (termed 'vanilla').<br>

#### Benefits Of Being A Modded Client.<br>

- Custom start screen displaying Role Name & Ability/Win Condition (Victory Parameters)
- Custom victory screen reflecting the Role's unique win condition.
- Ability to view additional settings in lobby. 
- Usable Hotkeys

Templates (README)

## Templates

__Location__: `LOTUS_DATA/Templates.yaml`<br>
__Chat Command__: /t _or_ /template _or_ /templates [tag]<br>

Templates allow you to send pre-written and frequently used blocks of text in chat. They offer endless possibilities and are commonly used for various purposes, such as welcome messages, rules, first meeting messages, and commonly used statements.

To access your saved templates, you or another player can type /t [tag] (e.g. /t rules). If the host types the message, the tag will be hidden (so no one will know you are using it to show messages), but the text will be shown to everyone. If a player types the same command, the tag will show for everyone, but the message will be shown privately (only to the player).


#### Command Guide

This table serves as a quick reference for the different commands you can use with the template system. The host can use tags to customize the lobby and help players understand the game.

| Command                      | Alias                 | Description                                                    |

| `/t tags`                    |                       | Shows all tags built into the mod                              |
| `/t variables`               | `/t v`                | Shows all variables that can be used in templates              |

#### Tag Customization

### Template Customization

There are endless possibilities when it comes to template customization in Project: Lotus. Not only are all the variables above usable in any templates created by the host, hosts can also use HTML and symbols to customize their templates even further. 

Here are some basic tools to get you started:

#### Usable HTML Tags 

| HTML Tag       | Description                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<b>`          | Bold text                                              |
| `<i>`          | Italicized text                                        |
| `<u>`          | Underlined text                                        |
| `<s>`          | Strikethrough text                                     |
| `<sub>`        | Subscript text                                         |
| `<sup>`        | Superscript text                                       |
| `<mark>`       | Highlighted or marked text                             |
| `<size= >`     | Size of text (Default AU size is 2)                    |
| `<color= >`    | Color of the text (use hex code)                       |


#### Usable Unicode Symbols

### Note On Template Creation
- The hyphen (-) is required
- The colon and space after it are required 
- The indentation of the word Text (aligning with the indentation of the word Tag) is required 
- You must capitalize Tag and Text (and any other parameter used in Template.yaml)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Friends

The native Among Us friends list is often considered pointless. However, with this system, you can create your own custom friend list easily using simple commands through the command line.

The friend list information is stored in the file `LOTUS_DATA/Friends.txt`.

Commands:

| Command                     | Function                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/friend add [playerId]`    | Adds a friend based on their player ID (1 - 15) |
| `/friend add [name]`        | Adds a friend based on their username           |
| `/friend remove [index]`    | Removes a friend based on their list position   |
| `/friend list`              | Lists all friends                               |


## Other Useful Commands

Here are some additional commands that you might find useful:

- `/kick [id]`: Kick a player based on their ID.
- `/ban [id]`: Ban a player based on their ID.

Use `/kick` or `/ban` without specifying an ID to obtain a list of available player IDs.

## Custom Tags

__Location__: `LOTUS_DATA/Titles'<br>
__File Type__: yaml<br>
__File Name__: Among Us Friend Code (e.g. envykindly#7034)<br>

Custom tags allow for players to add colors to their username as well as titles above their username in Among Us. In order for a host to add a players custom tag, they'll need to create a yaml file with any/all of the following information: 

```
UpperText:
 Text: # This is the text that goes above your username
 Gradient: # Creates a gradient FROM Color 1 to Color 2 automatically
 Size: # Default AU size is 2
  
Name: # This is the size and color/gradient attributed to your username. Leave this line blank and fill in the options below 
 Gradient: # Creates a gradient from Color 1 to Color 2 automatically. For gradient enter "[hex 1], [hex 2]" (refer to examples above)
 Size: # Default AU size is 2

Prefix: # This is the size, color, and text that goes before your username. Leave this line blank and fill in the options below
 Spaced: # This field is either True or False and used if there should be a space between the Suffix and the player's username (example: ♥ shiftyrose)
 Text: # Add the text you'd like to go before your username here   
 Color: # Add the hex code that you'd like the prefix to be here
 Size: # Default AU size is 2

Suffix: # This is the size, color, and text that goes after your username. Leave this line blank and fill in the options below
 Spaced: # This field is either True or False and used if there should be a space between the Suffix and the player's username (example: shiftyrose ♥)
 Text: # Add the text you'd like to go before your username here   
 Color: # Add the hex code that you'd like the prefix to be here
Size: # Default AU size is 2

LowerText:
 Text: # This is the text that goes below your username
 Gradient: # Creates a gradient FROM Color 1 to Color 2 automatically
 Size: # Default AU size is 2
```

__Creating A New Title__:<br>
Navigate to the `/LOTUS_DATA/Titles` directory<br>
Create a new yaml file named: `[friendcode].yaml` (example: `buffdulcet#0871.yaml`)<br>
Set up the title components in the yaml<br>

__Available Components__:<br>

| Components | Description                                             |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| UpperText  | Responsible for the text above the player's username    |
| LowerText  | Responsible for the text below the player's username    |
| Prefix     | The text that comes before a player's username          |
| Suffix     | The text that comes after a player's username           |
| Name       | The player's username                                   |

*The player's username is the name they enter the lobby with or change with /name. It is not specified directly in the yaml file.*

__Component Items__: <br>

These are the things you can define for each component to change

| Item     | Description                                                                                                   |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Text     | Sets the text for the component (does not work for Name)                                                      |
| Gradient | A list of HTML color codes defining a range of colors to apply to the text. (Refer to the example image)      |
| Color    | If gradient is not specified, a solid color to apply to the text                                              |
| Size     | The size of the text (default is 2)                                                                           |
| Spaced   | (Only applicable to Prefix & Suffix) Whether the text should have a space between it and the player's name    |


Lastly you can reload your (local) title files with the command '/tload', the change is __immediate__<br>

### Example Tags

#### Example 1

UpperText:<br>
> Text: The One Above All<br>
> Gradient: "#ff0000, #e1e100" #Creates a gradient FROM Color 1 to Color 2 automatically<br>
> Size: 2 # Default AU size is 2, i believe this is exponential (so 100 would be terrible)<br>
  
Name:<br>
> Gradient: "#e1e100, #ff0000" #Creates a gradient FROM Color 1 to Color 2 automatically<br>
> Size: 2 # Default AU size is 2, i believe this is exponential (so 100 would be terrible)<br>

Prefix:<br>
> Spaced: True # If there should be a space between the Suffix and the player's name (example: Akali ♥)<br>
